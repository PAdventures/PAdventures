# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @PAdventures

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in building a website for my Discord Bot
- âœ¨ I know JavaScript, TypeScript, Python and Lua (In terms of Robloxs' Lua)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C# and Rust
- 
- Want to be friends on Discord, or just want to contact me? Here's my totally unique username: `padventures`

## What I'm doing right now

I'm the head developer of the [Yara Discord Bot Project](https://github.com/PAdventures/Yara-mirror) which is an open source project that is being developed right now. It will soon be released to the public, hopefully by the start of 2024. [Join the discord for more info](https://discord.gg/bzFfMn3VPX)

I'm also the head developer of a Roblox Development Team building a Horror Game which is currently on pause due personal, more important, road blocks that myself and my co-worker is dealing with. [Join the discord for more info](https://discord.gg/nGCrZeBjRJ)

Finally I'm developing, as a simple developer ðŸ˜¢, a Discord Bot for a client along side a team. I cannot disclose any information on this project though, and I won't anyways.

So I guess you can say my hands are full at the moment!
