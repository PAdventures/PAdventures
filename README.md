# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @PAdventures

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in finishing my Discord.js Framework: [Vortexus.js (Private Repo ATM)](https://github.com/PAdventures/Vortexus.js)
- âœ¨ I know JavaScript, TypeScript, Python and Lua (In terms of Roblox)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Rust because I'm insane
- 
- Want to be friends on Discord, or just want to contact me? Here's my totally username: `padventures`

## What I'm doing right now

### Vortexus.js - Discord.js Framework

Vortexus.js is a (soon to be) open source [Discord.js](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js) framework inspired by the [Reciple](https://github.com/thenorthsolution/Reciple) framework.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Why is the [Vortexus.js](https://github.com/PAdventures/Vortexus.js) repo private right now?
> 
> It is currently being developed, and until I feel a sufficient amount of the framework is complete, it will stay that way

### Yara - Discord Bot Project

I'm the head developer of the [Yara Discord Bot](https://github.com/PAdventures/Yara-mirror) (currently on hold). It will hopefully soon be released to the public, [Join the discord for more info](https://discord.gg/bzFfMn3VPX)

### PJS Studios - Roblox Game Development Team

I'm also the head developer of a Roblox Development Team building a Horror Game which is currently on pause due personal, more important, road blocks that myself and my co-worker is dealing with. [Join the discord for more info](https://discord.gg/nGCrZeBjRJ)

So I guess you can say my hands are full at the moment!
